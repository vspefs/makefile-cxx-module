See [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1izg2cc/make_me_a_module_now/) for details. This is the referenced implementation of the post.

Things You Should Know:

1. Use my patched version of GCC [here](https://github.com/vspefs/gcc/tree/module-makefile-gen-fix).

2. There should be some script to automatically set CXX_STDMODULE. I didn't write one. Replace it with yours.

3. Feel free to edit and test.

Other Words:

1. The project and every file it contains are distributed under GNU Affero General Public License.

2. Please don't embarrass me if I'm wrong because I'm super noob and anxious about it.
